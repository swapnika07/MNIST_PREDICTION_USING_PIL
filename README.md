# MNIST_PREDICTION_USING_PIL
This project is based on the prediction for MNIST dataset Using Pillow library.

MNIST DATA : This is a prediction of digit recognization..
Step - 1:
Here in this we first tried to load the data into Jupyter notebook..
Step - 2:
After loading the data we tried to convert that images to convert into a dataframe by resize/flatten methods using for loop.
Step - 3:
After the conversion of dataframe with required libraries, converted into a csv file.
step - 4:
Splitting the data, Data-Preprocessing
Step - 5:
Using Different alogorithms to generate a model.
Step - 6:
Checked for an approriate model 
Step - 7:
Pickling
step - 8:
Unpickling
Step - 9:
Streamlit application usage for proper prediction.
